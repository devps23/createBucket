https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.45.4/prometheus-2.45.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
2.copy the prometheus service file
3.start the prometheus service
2. create ansible playbook

***********************************************************************
node_exporter will translate service to prometheus format

The Node Exporter is an agent that gathers system metrics and exposes them in a format which can be ingested by Prometheus.
to monitor the number of ec2instances in prometheus, we need to use ec2-sd-config
about aws_iam_policy:
======================
Here the aws_iam_policy block describes an IAM policy that allows read access for a specific ec2 instances.
We are attaching this policy to an IAM role created in the aws_iam_role block.
The role has a policy which allows EC2 service to assume the role.
At the end, aws_iam_role_policy_attachment block is used to attach the policy to the role.

to monitor specific instances in Prometheus:
============================================
EC2 SD configurations allow retrieving scrape targets from AWS EC2 instances.
 specific instances can be monitor in prometheus, use filters.
 filters:
   [ - name: <string>
       values: <string>, [...] ]
add these filters in configuration file i.e., prometheus.yml file.
* add "visual" to the tag in aws_instance
A scrape_config section specifies a set of targets and parameters.
to know the label name and value use
 relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
