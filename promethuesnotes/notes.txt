***********************************************************************
node_exporter will translate service to prometheus format

The Node Exporter is an agent that gathers system metrics and exposes them in a format which can be ingested by Prometheus.
to monitor the number of ec2instances in prometheus, we need to use ec2-sd-config
about aws_ial_policy:
======================
Here the aws_iam_policy block describes an IAM policy that allows read access for a specific ec2 instances.
We are attaching this policy to an IAM role created in the aws_iam_role block.
The role has a policy which allows EC2 service to assume the role.
At the end, aws_iam_role_policy_attachment block is used to attach the policy to the role.
